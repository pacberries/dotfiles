2. To use PulseAudio's daemon for sound, users should disable USE=sound-server
  for PipeWire, enable USE=daemon on media-sound/pulseaudio, and add
  media-sound/pulseaudio-daemon to their world file:

  Place the following entries in /etc/portage/package.use:
  ```
  media-video/pipewire -sound-server
  media-sound/pulseaudio daemon
  ```

  Add media-sound/pulseaudio-daemon to @world:
  # emerge --noreplace media-sound/pulseaudio-daemon

  Then perform a world upgrade:
  # emerge --ask --update --changed-use --deep @world

  Then depclean:
  # emerge --ask --depclean

  OpenRC users on an XDG-compliant desktop which respects autostart files
  will not need to take any further action.

  OpenRC users using a minimal desktop which does not respect autostart
  files should consider adding `gentoo-pipewire-launcher &` in e.g.
  `~/.xprofile` but it's not strictly required in terms of audio
  handling. It may be required in future for the non-audio usecases
  described above.

  systemd users will also need to run the following commands:
  $ systemctl --user --now enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
  $ systemctl --user --now disable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket

  Alternatively, systemd users can run the following commands as root to change
  the default for all users:
  # systemctl --global enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
  # systemctl --global --force disable pipewire.socket pipewire-pulse.socket

  (If taking this option, the services must be started manually as a one-off as
  a user.)
